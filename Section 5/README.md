  Run `main.m` for all of the simulations done on randomly sampled structure patterns.
  For solutions on the MATPOWER data, go to `simultations on MATPOWER data`

  To read the raw data obtained from the simulations by us and generate figures, go to the `data` folder
  `data/plotting_script.ipynb` generates Figures 2 and 3 from the paper out of
  the files `section 5.1 results.csv` and `section 5.2 results.csv` (note that if you do your own simulations, you
    would have to manually generate your own versions of these out of files like `raw data.csv` and `actual power system simulation result.csv`)
